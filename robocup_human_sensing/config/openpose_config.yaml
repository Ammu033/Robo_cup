openpose_config:
  openpose_normal_performance: "-1x160" # net resolution of the openpose when working on "normal" performance mode, has to be numbers multiple of 16, the default is "-1x368", and the fastest performance is "-1x160", used for human presence monitoring, "-1x320"
  openpose_high_performance: "-1x240" # net resolution of the openpose when working on "high" performance mode, used for gesture recognition, "-1x480"
  skeleton_extract_param: 19 #number of skeleton joints (openpose output) considered important for general posture and geture recognition, 19 means that feet joints are not considered
  joints_min: 4 # minimum number of joints in the skeleton detected that make it a valid detection
  confidence_min: 0.6 # minimim confidence factor used to consider a skeleton detected by Openpose valid or not
  selected_features: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,14] #list with indexes of the features (distances and angles) used to create the input for body gesture recognition ML model
