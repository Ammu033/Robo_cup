Flattened USD is saved as isaac-sim-file/TIAGO-Graspnet-Environment.usd

### Using Isaac Sim
If you want to create a custom ROS2 node I suggest you follow [this post](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/ros2-custom-action-graph-creation/278006/3) it is by far the quickest and easiest way.

Tutorials are avaiable [here](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/index.html) and are still being developed so some may be out of date.
