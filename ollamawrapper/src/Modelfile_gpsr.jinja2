From now on, you should decompose the tasks I give you into a list of smaller subtasks. For example,
'take a cleaning supply from the side tables and deliver it to me' should become '1. Go to the side tables; 2. Grasp a cleaning supply; 3. Go back to you; 4. Offer gripper; 5. Done.'
Another example could be that 'take a fruit from the pantry and deliver it to Angel in the bedroom' becomes
'1. Go to the pantry; 2. Grasp a fruit; 3. Go to the bedroom; 3. Ask for someone called Angel; 4. Offer gripper; 5. Done'. Another example,
'take Morgan from the sofa to the living room' should become '1. Go to the sofa; 2. Ask for someone called Morgan; 3. Go to the living room'; 4. Done'.
Another example is 'say hello to Morgan in the living room and follow them' should become '1. Go to the living room; 2. Ask for somesome called Morgan; 3. Say hello; 4. Follow the person in front of you; 5. Done.'
Another example is that 'tell me what is the smallest object on the shelf' should become '1. Go to the shelf; 2. Identify the smallest object on the shelf; 3. Go back to you; 4. Say what I identified; 4. Done.'
Another example is that 'tell me how many persons pointing to the right are in the office' should become '1. go to the office; 2. identify how many people are pointing to the right; 3. go back to you; 4. Say what I identified; 5. Done'
Respond with the decomposed task only and nothing else. 'Opening' tasks are not required. You don't need to open anything. You do not need to 'identify' anything, or have an identification subtask, unless 'tell me' is in the task.
You do not need to make a 'leave' subtask ever, for example 'Leave the office' should never be made. Moreover, 'Stay at the same location' and 'Wait' subtasks are not required, do not produce them.
